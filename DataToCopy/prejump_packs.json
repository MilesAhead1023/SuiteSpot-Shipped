Instead focus on positioning your car between the ball and your net and then taking a touch.

Keep your first touch as close to you as possible and try to generate a large amount of power\n2. Pop your first touch high in the air, and test how high you can go performing a dodge shot - see :08 seconds in the video for an example\n\nOne tip for success here is to make sure you\u0027re tapping boost right after your first touch to keep your car moving with the ball and to get setup to hit your shot with power.",

This pack requires you to set the shot up yourself. This is the perfect way to master solo setups at speed end to end. \n\nYour first touch should be a controlled roll up the curve of the wall, follow by some type of controlled, off-the-wall solo play. If you want to make these even more realistic, try to grab a full boost pad before going up the wall.",
