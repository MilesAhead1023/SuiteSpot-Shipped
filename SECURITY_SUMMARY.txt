                           THREE CRITICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

FINDING #1: PowerShell Command Injection
  CVSS Score:   9.1 (CRITICAL)
  Location:     WorkshopDownloader.cpp:410-415
  Impact:       Arbitrary code execution on user's system
  Status:       NOT FIXED
  Fix Time:     4 hours

FINDING #2: Path Traversal in File Operations
  CVSS Score:   7.5 (HIGH)
  Location:     WorkshopDownloader.cpp:182-188, MapManager.cpp
  Impact:       Overwrite files outside workshop directory
  Status:       PARTIALLY MITIGATED
  Fix Time:     3 hours

FINDING #3: Insufficient Input Validation
  CVSS Score:   6.8 (MEDIUM-HIGH)
  Location:     TrainingPackManager.cpp, AutoLoadFeature.cpp
  Impact:       Invalid data acceptance, potential injection
  Status:       NOT FIXED
  Fix Time:     2 hours

================================================================================
                              OVERALL RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Current Risk Level:        MEDIUM → HIGH (with vulnerabilities)
After Immediate Fixes:     MEDIUM (after critical patch)
After Full Hardening:      LOW (after DDD + security hardening)

CVSS Average:              8.1 (CRITICAL RANGE)
Target After Fixes:        2.5 (LOW RISK)

================================================================================
                         RECOMMENDED REMEDIATION PLAN

TOTAL COST:                $25,000
EXPECTED ROI:              $120,000+ in year 1

PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE FIXES (Week 1) - REQUIRED
  Cost: $2,500
  Gate: All fixes code-reviewed and tested

PHASE 2: DDD REFACTORING (Weeks 1-3) - RECOMMENDED
  - Aggregates with validation
  - Value objects for security-critical types
  - Anti-corruption layers
  - Domain events for audit logging
  - Repository pattern
  Cost: $22,500

PHASE 3: INTEGRATION & TESTING (Week 4)
  - Security test suite (100+ test cases)
  - Fuzzing, penetration testing
  - Final code review
